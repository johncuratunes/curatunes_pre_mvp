                        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                        <p>Big tech streaming services have a lot of influence on how music is made: 
                            music must be attention catching and likeable by the general 
                            public if it wants to be pushed out by the algorithm. Contrasting with 
                            that, we think that music should regain its freedom, and artists should 
                            be able to make a career out of their music, even out of a small and 
                            loyal fanbase. To solve this problem we have 3 major propositions:
                            a world map where users can discover music while also having the possibility
                            to filter by subgenre (this will help artists grow a local fanbase much quicker)
                             and curator-centric recommendations. The latter meaning that curators will be 
                             incentivised to make good playlists so that users follow them and discover 
                             new and meaningful music. On top of that, a Bandcamp-like support will be
                              available, so that artists are able to make a confortable living out of their music.</p>                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="whitepaper-section">
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p> We are in an ongoing crisis: terrible streaming revenue, AI bands, algorithms 
                            that control almost all recommendations, etc… As a consequence, many artists 
                            have to give up a part of their true identity to play the algorithm game. Logically, 
                            this does not lead to any good outcomes; music, in the most part, is becoming boring, soulless
                            and exclusively attention grabbing. But it's not the artist's fault, and as
                            many say, blame the game not the players. That is why in this paper we will
                            discuss our solutions in detail and also respond to the frequent questions
                            that arise when presenting such a disruptive project. We will start by explaining
                            why we will be a more appealing alternative to streaming platforms and then
                            describe our business project, which is key, even if this project is born from
                            a philanthropic spirit.</p>                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="whitepaper-section">
                        <h2>Why we will be a very appealing alternative</h2>
                        <p> Streaming platforms nowadays are focused on maximising the retention of users
                             in their platforms, so they can make more profit with ads. On top of that, 
                             paid subscriptions have rapidly been increasing their prices in these last 
                             few years, becoming way too expensive for the average user. And even worse, they do not pay
                             their artists well. It really seems that everybody 
                             loses but shareholders. With this in mind, a free to use and artist supportive 
                             platform becomes the ideal option. Furthermore, it will also rely on a more
                              human recommendation system, with  innovative features that will make the 
                              discovery of new music fun and exciting, not based on retention focused
                               algorithms, but more on the actual human quality of music.</p>                    </div>

                    <div class="whitepaper-section">
                        <h2>Key Features</h2>
                        <p>     The first feature is the “Valorisation of Curators”. To allow more
                             organic music discovery (and stop the big editorial pay-to-enter playlists),
                              users can become curators themselves. This way, if a user finds a knowledgeable 
                              curator with their same taste, they can follow them and discover new relevant music. 
                              To incentivise curators to make great playlists and build a large following, they will
                               get a small share of an artist's sales if the user that bought from the artist 
                               discovered them thanks to the curator.

                               In relation with the latter, the second feature is "Direct Artist Support", where users can directly
                               support their favourite musicians by buying anything that the artist offers.
                            
                            On top of that, we have many more ideas for the future of the platform, 
                            but for now we will put our focus on both of the above, as we want 
                            these features to be robust and of true quality.
                            </p>                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="whitepaper-section">
                        <h2>Our business plan                        </h2>
                        <p>Thanks to all the discovery features that help artists find their fanbase, 
                            users will be able to directly support their favourite musicians in two 
                            ways: subscribing for exclusive content and buying merch.
                             In every sale, Curatunes will take a cut to pay for the server costs and 
                             maintenance*. During the early stages of the project, the servers will
                              be paid by donations and a few ads (we will show exactly how much our server costs are, we will be transparent).
                            The excess will ONLY be used to grow the project.</p>
                        <p>*this is the Bandcamp business model (for them, consistently profitable since 2012)</p>                    </div>

                    <div class="whitepaper-section">
                        <h2>Frequent questions</h2>
                        <p>Will we get investors? If we are able to maintain the project 
                            on our own platform earnings, we will not. Otherwise, we will 
                            have to look at alternatives, because realising the project and 
                            making a real change is the most important thing to us. That is w
                            hy donations will be key in the earlier stages.</p>                    
                        <p>How will we deal with AI content? This is a very difficult question 
                            for every platform. Our temporary solution is (meanwhile the platform 
                            remains relatively small) to manually flag AI content. As we do not yet 
                            have a robust AI-detection technology, like Deezer for example, this 
                            will be our answer for now.</p>
                        <p>There are already other similar platforms, what will make Curatunes successful? Our attention to detail and user interface will be outstanding, this makes a lot of a bigger difference than cool features. Also, other similar projects are not targeted to the mainstream, meanwhile we will do so, so that our project makes a real and global change.</p> </div>
